1. Kernel:- The kernel is one of the core section of an operating system. It is responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS. This operating system contains distinct types of modules and cooperates with underlying hardware directly. The kernel facilitates required abstraction for hiding details of low-level hardware or application programs to the system. There are some of the important kernel types which are mentioned below:
-----------------------------------------
- Monolithic Kernel
- Micro kernels
- Exo kernels
- Hybrid kernels
-----------------------------------------

2. System Libraries:- These libraries can be specified as some special functions. These are applied for implementing the operating system's functionality and don't need code access rights of the modules of kernel.
-----------------------------------------
3. System Utility Programs:- It is responsible for doing specialized level and individual activities.
-----------------------------------------
4. Hardware layer:- Linux operating system contains a hardware layer that consists of several peripheral devices like CPU, HDD, and RAM.
-----------------------------------------
5. Shell:- It is an interface among the kernel and user. It can afford the services of kernel. It can take commands through the user and runs the functions of the kernel. The shell is available in distinct types of OSes. These operating systems are categorized into two different types, which are the graphical shells and command-line shells.
-----------------------------------------

The graphical line shells facilitate the graphical user interface, while the command line shells facilitate the command line interface. Thus, both of these shells implement operations. However, the graphical user interface shells work slower as compared to the command-line interface shells.

There are a few types of these shells which are categorized as follows:

- - - Korn shell
- - - Bourne shell
- - - C shell
- - - POSIX shell

## Linux Operating System Features
`Some of the primary features of Linux OS are as follows:`

- Portable: Linux OS can perform different types of hardware and the kernel of Linux supports the installation of any type of hardware environment.
- Open source: Linux operating system source code is available freely and for enhancing the capability of the Linux OS, several teams are performing in collaboration.
- Multiprogramming: Linux OS can be defined as a multiprogramming system. It means more than one application can be executed at the same time.
- Multi-user: Linux OS can also be defined as a multi-user system. It means more than one user can use the resources of the system such as application programs, memory, or RAM at the same time.
- Hierarchical file system: Linux OS affords a typical file structure where user files or system files are arranged.
- Security: Linux OS facilitates user security systems with the help of various features of authentication such as controlled access to specific files, password protection, or data encryption.
- Shell: Linux operating system facilitates a unique interpreter program. This type of program can be applied for executing commands of the operating system. It can be applied to perform various types of tasks such as call application programs and others.
