# Introduction:
A file system is one of the central OS subsystems. File systems continue to develop as operating systems evolve. Currently we have an entire heterogenetic zoo of file systems, from the old “classic” UFS, to the new exotic NILFS (though this idea isn’t new at all, look at LFS) and BTRFS. We aren’t going to try to throw down monsters like ext3/4 and BTRFS. Our file system will be of educational nature, and we will familiarize ourselves with the Linux kernel using its help.
